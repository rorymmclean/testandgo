                            individual basis, and that unless otherwise
                            expressly provided for, there are no conditions that
                            permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a
                            plaintiff or class member in any class or
                            representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral
                            tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's
                            claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
                            of a representative or class proceeding.
                            Notwithstanding the tribunal's power to rule on its
                            own jurisdiction and the validity or enforceability
                            of the agreement to arbitrate, the tribunal has no
                            power to rule on the validity or enforceability of
                            the agreement to arbitrate solely on an individual
                            basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party
                            may (i) bring claims in a North Carolina state or
                            federal court related to their intellectual property
                            rights and/or (ii) seek equitable or injunctive
                            relief without having to post a bond or other
                            security and without having to prove the inadequacy
                            of other available remedies.
